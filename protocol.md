This describes the protocol implemented in this crate. This protocol sends and receive strings with an host.

Types and functions are described using WAT syntax.

# Compilation

This protocol is only meant to be used by plugins compiled to 32-bits WebAssembly.

A plugin should compile to a shared WebAssembly library.

# Imports

Valid plugins need to import two functions (that will be provided by the runtime):

- `(import "typst_env" "wasm_minimal_protocol_write_args_to_buffer" (func (param i32)))`

  The argument is a pointer to a buffer (`ptr`).

  Write the arguments for the current functions into the buffer pointed at by `ptr`.

  Each function for the protocol receives lengths as its arguments (see [Exported functions](#exported-functions)). The capacity of the buffer pointed at by `ptr` should be at least the sum of all those lengths.

  The written bytes are guaranteed to be valid UTF-8.

- `(import "typst_env" "wasm_minimal_protocol_send_result_to_host" (func (param i32 i32)))`

  The first parameter is a pointer to a buffer (`ptr`), the second is the length of the buffer (`len`).

  Reads `len` bytes pointed at by `ptr` into host memory. The memory pointed at by `ptr` can be freed immediately after this function returns.

  The buffer should contain valid UTF-8.

# Exported functions

To conform to the protocol, an exported function should:

- Take `n` arguments `a₁`, `a₂`, ..., `aₙ` of type `u32` (interpreted as lengths, so `usize/size_t` may be preferable), and return one `i32`.
- The function should first allocate a buffer `buf` of length `a₁ + a₂ + ⋯ + aₙ`, and call `wasm_minimal_protocol_write_args_to_buffer(buf.ptr)`.
- The `a₁` first bytes of the buffer constitute the first argument, the `a₂` next bytes the second argument, and so on.
- Before returning, the function should call `wasm_minimal_protocol_send_result_to_host` to send its result back to the host.
- To signal success, the function should return `0`.
- To signal an error, the function should return `1`. The written buffer is then interpreted as an error message.
