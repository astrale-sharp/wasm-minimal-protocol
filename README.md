## You want to write a plugin

A plugin can be written in Rust, C, Zig, or any language than compiles to WebAssembly.

Rust plugins can use this crate to automatically implement the protocol with a macro:

```rust
use wasm_minimal_protocol::*;

initiate_protocol!();

#[wasm_func]
pub fn hello() -> Vec<u8> {
    b"Hello from wasm!!!".to_vec()
}
```

For others, the protocols is described in the file [protocol.md](./protocol.md). You should also take a look at the [examples](#examples).

## Examples

Examples are implemented in [Rust](examples/hello_rust/), [Zig](examples/hello_zig/) and [C](examples/hello_c/). Each of them is run using the [test-runner](examples/test-runner/).

The example can run using [`wasmi`](https://github.com/paritytech/wasmi).

The command to run examples (from the top-level directory) is:

```sh
cargo run [--features wasi] -- <lang>
# or
cargo run [--features wasi] -- -i <PATH> <func> <args>
```

Where:

- `<lang>` is `rust`, `zig` or `c`
- add `wasi` to the list of features to compile the example with WASI (required on the C example) and stub all the resulting WASI function if the runner is `host-wasmi`.
- `<PATH>` is the path to a wasm file
- `<func>` is the exported function to call in the wasm file, with `<args>` as arguments

### Dependencies

- All commands require a valid [Rust toolchain](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
- The Zig example requires the [Zig toolchain](https://ziglang.org/learn/getting-started/#installing-zig).
- The C example requires [emscripten](https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html).

### Some commands

```sh
cargo run -- rust # compile and run the Rust example
cargo run --features wasi -- rust # compile and run the Rust example with WASI (stubbed)
cargo run -- zig # compile and run the Zig example
# NOTE: this needs the wasi feature, as `emcc` only compiles in WASI.
cargo run --features wasi -- c # compile and run the C example
cargo run -- -i MY_WASM_FILE.wasm MY_FUNCTION arg1 arg2
```

If you wish to build the example directly, you may use the following commands:
Here `|` indicate that you can choose between options, it's not the pipe operator.
You need to remove the choices you don't want along with the `|` before executing the command.

```sh
# rust
# from the directory examples/hello_rust
cargo build --target wasm32-wasi|wasm32-unknown-unknown

# zig
# from the directory examples/hello_zig
zig build-lib hello.zig -target wasm32-wasi|wasm32-freestanding -dynamic -rdynamic

# C
# from the directory examples/hello_c
emcc --no-entry -s ERROR_ON_UNDEFINED_SYMBOLS=0 -o hello.wasm hello.c
```

### Tips

- `host-wasmi` does not support running with WASI, and will stub all WASI functions instead.
- host-wasmi compiles fastest ðŸ˜‰
